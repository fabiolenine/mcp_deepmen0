"""Page-aware text chunking for document ingestion (v0.5a).

Pure stdlib, no project imports — deliberately: this module is a candidate for
promotion into the DeepMem0 fork core (mem0/utils/chunking.py) once the fork
grows a document API; keeping it dependency-free makes that a copy+test.

Strategy: pages are the natural boundary. Small pages merge until the chunk
budget fills; oversized pages split at paragraph breaks, then sentence breaks,
then hard-split as a last resort. Each chunk remembers the 1-based page range
it came from — that page range is the provenance stored on every extracted
memory. A short tail overlap between consecutive chunks of the SAME page keeps
facts that straddle a split visible to both extractions; no overlap is added
across page boundaries (page text does not repeat itself).
